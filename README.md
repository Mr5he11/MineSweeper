# MineSweeper

A programming class project made with ❤️.
This is a simple minesweeper game in italian language made to run as a cli game.
You can use docker to build and run the project as follow:
```bash
docker build -t minesweeper .
docker run -it -rm --name minesweeper-running minesweeper
```
Or you can try to compile the project by yourself with `$ make game`, but it could not work.

Please remember that this project was made for an assignment of the programming course of my first college year, so don't judge me pls 🙏
